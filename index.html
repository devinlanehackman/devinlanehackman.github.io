<h1>Devin Hackman</h1>
<p>My name is Devin Hackman and I am a student at wake tech working on the portfolio project that you see here.<br> I have about two years of professional experience in customer service but Iâ€™m looking to expand my skills<br> to technology. At the point of writing this I have completed a Udacity nanodegree in several coding languages<br> including html, CSS, python, and JavaScript. My hobbies include gaming (mostly single player RPGs)<br> and Magic the Gathering. I hope this website will help display my technical skills and me as a person<br> and I hope you are interested in talking with me further; enjoy.</p>
